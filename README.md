# Task2

Module 1 is the main file

Role Based Access Control:

Implement a role-based authentication system. System should be able to assign a role to user and remove a user from the role.
Entities are USER, ACTION TYPE, RESOURCE, ROLE

ACTION TYPE defines the access level (Ex: READ, WRITE, DELETE)
Resource Storage: Database (PostgreSQL or Mongo)
Access to resources for users are controlled strictly by the role. One user can have multiple roles. 
Given a user, action type and resource system should be able to tell whether user has access or not.
Note:
• Create class-based structure using OOPS concept.
• Follow file structure to make code maintainable and production ready.
• Go through git commands and push the code in git with README.md.
• This is a command line application.
• You do not need to create functionality to add/delete/update users or any other entities. You can get it pre-created.


Notes:
The role based access control was developed on a local server.
Add user, delete user , update user and access resource imported from pre created functions.
